# randomized_stock_pipeline
This project simulates transactional data for a fictional stock market to monitor the daily value of various stocks. It then builds a complete data pipeline that moves the generated data from local simulation to analytics-ready storage in Amazon Redshift.
The pipeline is designed to mirror a real-world scenario, where stock data is produced in large volumes, stored in the cloud, processed, and analyzed‚Äîall using automated, scalable tools.

## üñºÔ∏è DAG Overview

![DAG Screenshot](./2.PNG)

The DAG is named `chiz_daily_to_redshift` and includes three main tasks:

- `generate_transaction_data` ‚Äì PythonOperator  
- `upload_to_s3` ‚Äì PythonOperator  
- `load_to_redshift` ‚Äì S3ToRedshiftOperator  

All tasks complete successfully as shown above, indicating a healthy DAG run.
